<title>MMP Gems Article: Using the Twisted Framework for MMP Service
Integration</title>

</head>

<body>
<h1>Using the Twisted Framework for MMP Service Integration</h1>

<h2>A Brief Description of the Problem</h2>

<p>Massively multiplayer games are among the most complex software systems in
the world.  Allowing thousands of people to run around in the same space at the
same time, fighting the same enemies and exhausting the same resources, is a
pretty major challenge.  There is another important challenge that these games
must face, though, which is often ignored and deferred to ad-hoc implementation
later by a Live Team.  Integrating external services into an MMP virtual world
is difficult, and will increase in importance as MMP games make their way
further towards the mainstream gaming audience and the stakes for keeping
subscribers get higher.</p>

<p>There are some obvious bits of functionality that a game will need that
external tools can help with.  Games need a chat system; if for nothing else,
to interact with your customers and provide support inside the game.
Third-party messaging systems can implement that.  External reporting tools can
extract game data from a relational database and provide reports to marketing
personnel and executives.</p>

<p>Once the game's core functionality is already designed, it may be tempting
to ignore integrating extra stuff.  Why bother integrating an external chat
system when you've got a perfectly clear design for one?  The organizational
effort, both political and technical, of providing mechanisms for third-party
integration is substantial, and it's a common decision to forego it for
schedule-related reasons.</p>

<p>Looking at only these initial problems, the call is difficult to make.
Integration provides some benefits, but may not be worth the effort.  Once you
start looking out towards the horizon of a game's lifetime, though, it becomes
clear that integration is unavoidable: the best you can do is prepare for
it. </p>

<p>For example, let's say that as it inevitably happens, there is a bug in some
version of the client software that a group of player figures out how to
exploit to crash other people out of the game.  If there is only one mechanism
for accessing the game world -- the release game client (perhaps with
game-master extensions for trusted users) -- then there is no recourse for
support personnel to access the game world and correct potential problems
caused by this flaw until it is corrected by developers; this may take days or
even weeks, depending on the severity or complexity of the problem.</p>

<p>The complexity of simple additions, such as chat, is often underestimated.
For example, players who find the in-game chat system too restrictive or
limiting will resort to using other, external programs that better suit their
needs.  Your support staff may find themselves responding to reports of players
being harassed by other players on chat services like internet relay chat, on
servers that they cannot even log in to, let alone get log files and
administrator access.</p>

<p>The benefits of integrating with a relational database for data storage
rather than doing one's own ad-hoc data storage mechanism are more widely
understood: writing your own data storage layer means you need to write all of
your own reporting and extraction tools as well, not to mention the difficulty
of getting storage management done right in the first place!</p>

<p>This may all seem like a long-winded appeal to the well-worn object-oriented
<q>software reuse</q> rhetoric.  It's not the same, though; integrating with
existing, working, proven solutions is better than writing your own, in cases
where the problem is not your business's core area of competency.  Even if your
organization is capable of making fantastic re-use of code developed
internally, it's not as good as never having to do that development at all.</p>

<p>In other words, do you <em>really</em> want to be developing yet another
technical support ticket-tracking system this year, or do you want to be
writing a game that's compelling and fun? </p>

<h2>The Problems with Doing It Yourself</h2>

<p>Questions of integration and extensibility work their way into every layer
of a system.  Making a robust, extensible infrastructure is a very challenging
problem.  It's also a totally different problem than making a simple, playable,
shippable game.  In fact, as the Extreme Programming methodology indicates, it
is a waste of resources to prematurely plan for extensibility; the only way to
really determine if a particular mechanism for extension is necessary is to
find a use-case for it.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that you'll never need extensibility.  It means that the
only way to build an extensible system is to have it hammered on over a long
period of time by a large base of users with diverse interests, to expose where
it really needs to be extended, improved, and stabilized. </p>

<p>Purpose-built frameworks do not integrate different services well, precisely
because their audience is limited and their time of development is often short.
It is difficult to anticipate the hooks you will need later in development to
provide unexpected functionality, and guessing wrong will take time away from
important core features to implement potentially useless extensions.  Building
an infrastructure that works great for your gameplay may end up being a serious
liability for your customer support.</p>

<p>Finally, if you build an infrastructure yourself from top to bottom, even if
it is brilliant and wonderful and extensible, what third-party developers will
be able to add features, either for free or in commercial bundles, that you
would find useful?  Even the best-designed modular integration package isn't
useful if knowledge about how to build modules for it is limited to a small
group. </p>

<h2>The Problems with Paying Somebody to Do It For You</h2>

<p>Existing <q>turnkey</q> MMP solutions have surprisingly similar problems.
While they provide a lot more tools <q>out of the box</q>, their extremely high
cost keeps third-party developers from creating any additional tools.  At best,
you will be in a situation where you can price different components of
infrastructure from the same vendor separately, and that model is still
unusual.  Restrictive licensing agreements make development of open-source
components for these systems difficult if not impossible.  As more and more
games turn to BSD and Linux servers, using open-source components internally
like Python and Lua, the importance of these robust back-end tools is
increasingly obvious.</p>

<p>Packaged MMP solutions are also sometimes flexible in the wrong areas.  They
will provide a complete implementation of game-world infrastructure, limiting
the possibilities for unusual gameplay, but they will not provide external
tools that are not interesting for game developers to experiment with.</p>

<p>Outside of the game industry, other kinds of general networking, distributed
computing, and data-storage infrastructure exist.  This category comprises
things like implementations of the J2EE API. From their product descriptions,
these might sound appropriate starting-points for game infrastructure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of these products are highly expensive middleware
targeted at batch transaction processing.  Games involve a dynamic, event-based
interactions.  Infrastructure that cannot respond to player actions in soft
real-time can't be made to work for the most basic operations in the game
world, regardless of suitability for any other integration tasks.</p>

<h2>A Summary of the Problem</h2>

<p>In order to allow for the flexibility necessary to economically run a
massively multiplayer game, it's important to use an infrastructure for
development which allows for the event-based nature of multiplayer games,
provides enough services to make any additional training expenses worthwhile,
and provides public programming interfaces so that more than one group's
expertise can be brought to bear on the very different problem domains that
make a complete MMP solution. </p>

<h2>Framing a Solution</h2>

<p>The Twisted Network Framework is one such solution.  Although it is a
completely generic network applications platform, already in use in several
different application domains, it was designed from the beginning with support
for massively multiplayer games as a design goal.  As Open Source software,
there is a large and enthusiastic community.  It is also an event-based
networking platform with support both for high-level programming (in Python)
and speed-critical extensions (in C and C++). </p>

<p>Twisted may not be appropriate for everyone.  If for some reason the
specific implementations described in this article are inappropriate for your
specific needs, keep in mind that the problems remain, and similar approaches
to the solution are probably a good idea.</p>

<p>In providing code examples, I will assume a familiarity both with the basics
of network programming and Python.  I'll be discussing these tools in the
context of a hypothetical game called <q>Metamorphosis Online</q>, in which the
players are clinically depressed insects. </p>

<h2>A Gentle Introduction: Generalized Deferred Execution</h2>

<p>One of the most basic ways in which Twisted allows network applications to
be integrated is that it specifies a general mechanism for wrapping potentially
blocking activities.</p>

<p>In many asynchronous networking frameworks, the primary way that blocking
activities are represented are as callbacks.  Objects conforming to a specific
interface must be passed in as an argument to any function which needs to wait
for a blocking operation. These interfaces often differ for different types of
blocking operations, which creates two problems.  One, passing additional
arguments to the callbacks may be unwieldy.  Two, since the interfaces are
different, any two blocking systems that want to communicate must have specific
glue code between them, and often present a third, different public
interface. </p>

<p>Twisted eliminates these problems with the
<code>twisted.internet.defer</code> module.  <em>All</em> functions which may
wait on a blocking operation will result return <code>Deferred</code>
instances.  A <code>Deferred</code> acts as two logical chains of functions;
one for errors and one for results.  When the result of a Deferred becomes
available, it passes it to the first callback in the chain, then passes the
result of that callback to the second.  If there is ever an error, the
error-handling callback is invoked instead. This was inspired in part by the
"Eventually" operator in the E language and has most of its deadlock-avoidance
properties.</p>

<p>Also, because <code>Deferred</code> will accept any function which takes one
argument and returns one result, many python standard library functions will
work fine. </p>

<p>Here are some examples of how Deferred is used.</p>

<a href="defer-examples.py" class="py-listing">Deferred Examples</a>

<p>Now that you've seen a basic introduction, let's look a little deeper into
what makes that <code>callRemote</code> work.</p>

<h2>High Level Network Services: Perspective Broker</h2>

<p>One of the most powerful tools that Twisted provides to the network
application developer is its own multi-purpose remote method invocation
protocol, Perspective Broker, affectionately known as PB.  PB was designed from
the ground up with several integration-minded goals.

<ul>
  
  <li>PB operates over a single transport connection, allowing both
  client/server (untrusted, widely distributed) and server/server (trusted,
  locally clustered) communication.  This can reduce the total amount of
  communication code your system needs.</li>
  
  <li>PB is highly customizable, and provides hooks at all three layers of
  decoding: (un)marshalling, (de)serializing, and message routing.  This allows
  PB to remain very generic and compatible, but still be very responsive to the
  needs of your specific application.</li>

  <li>PB provides object-to-object, not process-to-process communication. This
  allows multiple services to be transparently multiplexed over one connection,
  which in turn allows independent functionality to be integrated into existing
  servers and clients.</li>

  <li>PB uses dynamic method lookup and method routing.  This allows upgrade
  transitions from one client/server version to the next to be smooth; your
  choice of how long to maintain support for legacy clients is not made by
  fragile technology. </li>

  <li>PB provides for secure, robust authentication at the protocol level.
  </li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Many of these features are interesting and useful, but most critical is the
ability to integrate independently-developed services over the same network
connection without time-consuming integration work on disparate code-bases.
This is useful both externally -- making use of code available from third-party
vendors and volunteers -- as well as internally.  Using PB or a technology like
it will allow you to parallelize your server-side development process, by
allowing teams working on abstractly un-related features like <q>chat</q> and
<q>inventory</q> to be completely independent of each other. </p>

<p>Authentication, too, is an important part of this puzzle.  Regardless of the
type of service being accessed, the user will need to be authenticated with
some service in order to verify that they have the authority to use that
service.</p>

<p>Twisted uses its authentication model, <code>twisted.cred</code>, to unify
services in Perspective Broker.</p>

<h3>An Interlude with <code>twisted.cred</code></h3>

<p>Twisted Cred breaks down authentication into four major abstractions:
<code>twisted.cred.service.Service</code>,
<code>twisted.cred.perspective.Perspective</code>,
<code>twisted.cred.authorizer.Authorizer</code>, and
<code>twisted.cred.identity.Identity</code>.  The first two are specific to
your application, and the second two are specific to authorization.</p>

<p>A <code>Service</code> is an over-arching abstraction that represents the
whole service you want to provide.  This object performs a role similar to the
Manager design pattern, for whatever objects need to be <q>globally</q> tracked
in a particular subsystem.  A <code>Service</code> should contain all the state
related to one logical service.  In the average application, you will end up
writing at least one subclass of <code>Service</code>, and probably two or
three.</p>

<p>The primary objects that your <code>Service</code> will be managing are
<code>Perspective</code> instances.  For each <code>Service</code> subclass
there will generally be a corresponding <code>Perspective</code> subclass, and
the <code>Service</code> will only manage <code>Perspective</code> instances
that it instantiated itself.  A <code>Perspective</code> represents the state
of a user with respect to a given Service.  It is the contact point between the
user's persona and the functionality that they are working with in the
<code>Service</code>.  Each <code>Perspective</code> has a name.</p>

<p>The object which manages authentication is an Authorizer.  In the average
Twisted application, you will not need to implement an Authorizer, because you
can use an existing one.  You can authenticate out of a file, a database, or a
table in memory.  Depending on where you want to store your authentication, it
may be necessary to implement your own Authorizer to load and save account
information.</p>

<p>An Authorizer is essentially a persistent collection of Identity instances.
Each Identity generally represents one real person who has access to the game
system.  The only reason you would ever need to implement a new variety of
Identity is to implement a new style of authorization.  Twisted comes with
Identity implementations that can use plain password and challenge-response
authentication.  A secure-shell public-key cryptographic authorization
mechanism is also implemented for use with secure shell clients.  An Identity
maintains not only the credentials that the user must present, but information
about what Perspective instances that user has access to, once validated.</p>

<p><code>twisted.cred</code> interfaces very tightly with Perspective
Broker.</p>

<p>The examples here will be covering the use of built in authentication
mechanisms, and creating new services.  Let's take some of these basic building
blocks and explore an example of their use in a real-world situation.</p>

<h3>A Simple Example: Fritz and Franz go to the Psychologist</h3>

<p>In our initial <q>Day in the Life</q> for <u>Metamorphosis Online</u>, two
players, Joe and Bob, log in to play their characters, Franz and Fritz.  Franz
and Fritz need to meet each other for group therapy at the psychologist's
office. </p>

<p>In this example, Franz and Fritz first coordinate with each other by talking
about the appointment on their cell phones, then negotiating the game world's
hazards and finally arriving on time to the office.</p>

<p>While the game simulation is difficult to factor into separate Services, the
notion of globally addressing the player (with all the attendant concerns for
feature-completeness, like logging, auditing, message throttling, obscenity
filtering, and so on) is definitely separable.</p>

<p>For this example we will be implementing our own simple <q>cell phone</q>
based chat system.  In a more realistic situation it would probably be
advisable to use the integrated <code>twisted.words</code> chat package and
attendant utilities.</p>

<h4> About the Code Listings</h4>

<p>The following code examples are each meant to be in one source file.  These
listings, plus a Twisted installation, should make a complete (although small)
application.</p>

<a href="cellphone.py" class="py-listing">Cell Phone Service </a>

<p>In this first listing, we have a cell-phone service which is usable on its
own, not specific to any game.  Each player is represented to this service as a
<code>Cellphone</code> instance, uniquely identified by a phone number, which
serves as the name of this perspective.  Note the methods whose names begin
with <code>perspective_</code>; those can be called directly by a network
client of this service.</p>

<a href="metamorph.py" class="py-listing">
<u>Metamorphosis</u> Game module
</a>

<p>In this second listing, we define an extremely simple game.  This provides
an additional class for the simulation beyond the Perspective and Service (the
Psychologist), to demonstrate mediated communication between perspectives.
Again, <code>perspective_</code> methods comprise the remote interface
between clients and servers for this game.</p>

<p>We have now implemented two modules which are complete, but completely
unrelated. The way in which they've been implemented is important, however.
Their parallel structure, imposed by Perspective Broker, allows us to integrate
them into a single server with just one short file. </p>

<a href="fritz-franz-setup.py" class="py-listing">
Account Manipulation Example
</a>

<p>Finally, we unify these services by creating accounts for Bob and Joe.  The
real meat of this example is the makeAccount method, which produces Identity
instances that have the correct Perspectives attached.</p>

<p>By modifying this one file, we can add arbitrary additional services.  There
are three steps to this process:

<ol>
  
  <li>Instantiate the new <code>Service</code> (in the section "Create our
  services...")</li>
  
  
  <li>Call our service's <code>createPerspective</code> method to generate a
  new perspective.</li>

  <li>Add a key for that perspective to the appropriate <code>Identity</code>
object, declaring that a user who presents credentials to that
<code>Identity</code> is permitted access to it.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>Now, how do Joe and Bob actually get into the game?  A full-blown,
interactive client could be the subject of another article, but here is a
simple example that will log into <u>Metamorphosis</u> and play it for 5
seconds.</p>

<a href="metaclient.py" class="py-listing">
Client Code Example
</a>

<p>The primary responsibility of client code is to provide client objects for
each Perspective that exists on the server, to receive notifications that the
server may send.  A few lines of glue code are required to get those
client-side instances hooked up to server-side perspectives, but these are
mostly using glue code provided by the server.</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="login-sequence.png" /> <br />
Figure 1 - Login Sequence
</div>

<p>Figure 1 is a visual explanation of the login sequence that PB applications
require.  There are 8 basic steps to the interaction that client and server go
through in order to get a working session set up, represented by the numbered
arrows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The client contacts the authorizer and requests to log in.</li>
  
  <li>The client provides a username and password through a challenge/response
  conversation, ensuring that the password is secure even on un-encrypted
  connections.</li>
  
  <li>The challenge/response process locates an Identity object and validates
  against it.</li>
  
  <li>The client is then given a remote reference object which points at the
  Identity. </li>
  
  <li>The client makes a request for some perspective using a service name /
  perspective name pair, and specifying a 'client' object to connect to the
  perspective once located.  This is the <code>attach</code> method in the
  Identity's interface.</li>
  
  <li>If the identity has a key for that service/perspective name pair, the
  Identity looks up the appropriate service.
  </li>
  
  <li>The service then loads the perspective from its persistent storage and
  returns it, calling the attached method on the loaded perspective.</li>
  
  <li>The perspectives are returned to the client and associated with
  client-side objects.  Communication from client objects begins.</li>
  
</ol>

<h3>Emergent Features</h3>

<p><u>Metamorphosis</u> was a very simple example of the application of
Twisted, but it nevertheless applies a number of very useful technologies.  The
most immediately obvious benefit of the example is that extremely simple
clients such as this one can be very helpful for server load-testing.  The
ability to access the game server with alternate, simplified clients can be
indispensable for support personnel, as both a defense against potential
instabilities in portions of the official client code and as a mechanism for
automation of simple frequently-performed tasks.</p>

<p>You also benefit from the lower-level networking architecture in Twisted.
After generating an encryption key, you can secure the PB connection using the
industry standard Secure Sockets Layer.  This is as simple as replacing the
server's call to <code>listenTCP</code> with <code>listenSSL</code>.</p>

<p>One of the other advantages of this approach is that it has good security
properties.  Often you will want to provide certain convenience functionality
for game-masters in the distributed client, but you don't want users to be able
to access it.  In <code>twisted.cred</code>, you can encapsulate this risky
functionality in a separate Perspective and never even give player Identity
objects a key to access a Perspective of that type.  This reduces the need for
writing access checks in methods; by avoiding the need for these checks, you
can't forget to put such a check in - by default, insecure functionality just
won't be available.</p>

<h2>Web-Based Tools</h2>

<p>Any discussion of integration of network technologies in this increasingly
web-driven era has to include some mention of HTTP or legacy protocol support.
Twisted includes a robust, flexible web-server, which can function both as a
stand-alone server and as a framework for publishing other Twisted objects on
the web. </p>

<p>Web browsers are ubiquitous, robust clients.  The web can serve as a
convenient mechanism for statistics reporting, an administrative front-end for
support technicians, a place to display persistent laddering information for
bragging rights, even a minimal game-client for users.</p>

<p>In addition to a web server, Twisted provides a templating and application
framework for browser-based applications.  Taken together, the working title
for these tools is WebMVC.  WebMVC takes a slightly unusual approach to the
problem of building web applications.  Many web-specific languages and server
APIs treat a relational database as the integration point between the web and
your application, and assume that your whole application is being written for
the web alone. Twisted instead assumes that you have existing application
components that you'll want to put on web pages, and therefore hooks those
objects directly to the web.</p>

<p>To put it more simply, WebMVC treats the web more like a GUI toolkit in the
Model/View/Controller pattern than a batch output format.  It is designed for
real-time, web-based interaction with a running system. </p>

<p>In that spirit of publishing existing objects on the web, let's take the
example from above and integrate some simple web functionality with it, by
displaying a listing of all players.</p>

<p>First, we will create an HTML template which specifies our intent.</p>

<a href="metaweb.html" class="html-listing">Rankings Web Template</a>

<p>WebMVC expects all template files to be well-formed XML.  If you're familiar
with HTML already, but not XML, this just means you need to put a
<code>/</code> before the <code>&gt;</code> in any tag which does not close,
such as HR and BR.</p>

<p>This file is <em>only</em> a template.  It does not specify any presentation
logic or data, only what the output ought to look like.  Notice that we are
notating certain parts of the document for use by the code, with attributes
such as <code>view</code>, <code>rowOf</code> and <code>columnOf</code>.</p>

<a href="metaweb.py" class="py-listing">Presentation Logic Module</a>

<p>After creating a template, we create a presentation logic module, where we
retrieve and format the data using the WWW Consortium (W3C) standard Document
Object Model (DOM) API. Presentation logic in WebMVC is evaluated in roughly
four steps.

<ol>
  <li>The template is read in to a DOM tree.</li>

  <li>Particular nodes (those with <code>view</code> attributes) are found in a
  depth-first search.</li>
  
  <li>Methods named <code>factory_<i>[view attribute]</i></code> are invoked
  with those nodes.  These methods modify the nodes in the parsed XML tree that
  resulted from the template.</li>

  <li>The tree, thus manipulated, is sent to the web browser as a stream of
  XHTML text.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>We now need a way to test this code.  This will require going back to the
earlier example, <code>fritz-franz-setup.py</code> and modifying our server to
also run an HTTP server in addition to a PB server.  Add the following snippet
to that file, before the <code>app.run()</code> line.</p>

<a href="add-web.py" class="py-listing">Additions to make Metamorphosis a Web server.</a>

<p>This creates a webserver that serves files out of the same directory where
the server is running.  It also specifies a type of file which is to be
interpreted as dynamic content: any file with the extension <code>.rpy</code>
is a <code>ResourceScript</code>, which means it is a Python file which is
evaluated to produce an instance of a web resource.</p>

<p>As a final step, we must create a <code>.rpy</code> file which specifies the
Model of the web application.  This  </p>

<a href="metaweb.rpy" class="py-listing">Resource Loader File</a>

<p>Since <code>fritz-franz-setup.py</code> is the <code>__main__</code> module
of this program, we can locate the BuggyWorld service that we instantiated
there.</p>

<p>The game is now running its own web server, which is both a full-featured,
secure, file-system web server, and a dynamic window into the game world.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the simple question of the corporate web-site for
the game.  Twisted Web provides direct support for the Zope application server,
which is rapidly becoming an industry standard for content management.  While
the development of a corporate website is outside the scope of this article, Zope
integration makes it easy to take the components described above and put them
into a website with news updates, message boards, and all the amenities of a
portal site with a few clicks on a management interface. </p>

<h2>Integrating Independent Objects</h2>

<p>Object-Oriented Programming techniques have long been touted as a solution
to integration problems.  As any experienced software developer should know,
there is some truth to this claim, but it has been endlessly exaggerated by
software development tool companies.  The hit-and-miss nature of OOP can mostly
be traced to 2 factors: an overly broad definition of what is and is not
<q>Object Oriented</q>, and an institutional unwillingness to separate the
techniques used in OOP into <q>good</q> and <q>bad</q> categories.</p>

<p>So far, we have discussed how to make use of Twisted's services to
facilitate integrating with external tools.  Now we will touch on how it is
that Twisted can provide such a diverse array of services internally without
suffering from an entanglement of dependencies.</p>

<p>The chief concept governing Twisted's design in this regard is
<em>separability</em>.  The easier it is to separately instantiate two
different classes and have them perform their function, the less likely it is
that changes in one will destabilize the other.  Also, the less a new user
needs to know in order to use one of the classes.</p>

<p>Since separate instances are considered a good thing in general, Twisted
avoids inheritance in most cases, using it only where two classes must be very
tightly coupled, or the base class is very simple and provides only utility
functionality.</p>

<p>Again, this approach has good security properties.  When some objects are
network accessible, it is important to carefully separate out sensitive
operations and make sure they are far from a potential source of access. If
most functions are factored into separate classes, that separation guards
against mistakes in access control. </p>

<p>This is an old idea.  In fact, it was in some ways the origin of
object-oriented programming, stemming from the Actor model of simulation.  The
Actor model is still mainly of interest for the reasons mentioned above;
networking and security.  This is also a new idea.  Most of the substance of
the craze over various "component architectures" can be boiled down to one
simple feature. Such architectures force objects to separate their
functionality into discrete, separately usable packages. </p>

<p>Twisted has such a boiled down component architecture in
<code>twisted.python.components</code>.  This is based heavily on the Zope3
component architecture.  While it does offer some advanced features, it is in
general a very simple system. It is almost entirely based around one feature,
which is the Adapter.</p>

<p>This listing shows the basic use of an Adapter.  Strictly speaking, an
Adapter is simply a class that takes one argument to its constructor.  Adapters
are registered to represent another class in contexts where a certain interface
is required, so Adapters will always implement at least one interface.</p>

<a href="component-example.py"
class="py-listing"><code>twisted.python.components</code> example</a>

<p>The component system in Twisted has been presented here as a way to
integrate external game services.  Much of the "behind the scenes" work
involved in the examples, especially the WebMVC examples, was being done by
Adapters.  The same properties that make it useful to develop a Web-publishing
system agnostic to the objects being published make it useful for other sorts
of separation.  For example, a Magic system agnostic to world geometry
representation.</p>

<h2>Low Level Integration: Protocols and Networking</h2>

<p>The lowest level of the Twisted infrastructure is
<code>twisted.internet</code>.  This portion of Twisted is the bedrock upon
which the rest of it is built.  Mostly, <code>twisted.internet</code> is a
networking core implemented in the style of the Reactor event-response
pattern.</p>

<p>Part of Twisted's design is that it is pluggable at every level, from the
highest-level message abstraction to the bits and bytes being sent on the wire.
This follows directly from Twisted's original MMP focus: this allows your
Twisted application to satisfy diverse requirements for efficiency and
flexibility depending on your exact needs. </p>

<p>The previous examples have already used the twisted.internet APIs in order
to connect Web and PB servers to the internet.  Here we will show how to write
your own kind of server.  The simplest example of how to extend Twisted at this
level is an echo server.</p>

<a href="echoserver.py" class="py-listing"> Echo Server </a>

<p>This small Python script is a fully functional, asynchronous, multiplexing
server using Twisted as a library.  This would be a good basic example to begin
working with in order to build a server-side processing system that needs to
interact with a non-standard legacy protocol in an existing multiplayer
infrastructure.</p>

<p>It is often desirable to implement alternative clients for such servers to
automate frequently-performed tasks, or to perform load-testing.  Twisted also
provides complete client-side support, intentionally designed to mirror the
server-side support as closely as possible.</p>

<a href="shoutclient.py" class="py-listing"> Shout Client </a>

<p>Notice that both the client and server examples end with
<code>reactor.run()</code>.  The same Reactor object is used on both client and
server.  In fact, any number of clients and/or servers can be run within the
same process.  </p>

<h2>Development Community</h2>

<p>Twisted provides many other protocols which may be of use.  Currently it
supports more than 10 RFCs, including internet mail protocols, asynchronous
database access, domain name servers and clients, and internet relay chat.</p>

<p>More interesting than the additional tools which already exist, though, is
the potential for future development.  A developer community with sustained
interest and investment in your platform of choice is important to assure that
support does not disappear overnight.  Also, the ability to collaborate with
and get support from an existing community can potentially vastly reduce the
amount of time it takes to develop a feature that does not yet exist. </p>

<p>A large and lively support community like Twisted's can arise from projects
which are not open-source, such as Java.  Such a community, however, is
indispensable to the reliability of a framework.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, open-source development communities tend to be interested
in obscure and difficult problems which are tricky to get right, but not really
a competitive advantage for anyone.  People who are working on tools like
Twisted for their own use are very concerned about stability, and the
collective focus of many diverse organizations on one project amplifies its
robustness considerably </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>When you are developing an MMP game, it's not just a game.  It's an entire
small universe of infrastructure.  You need tools for continuing development,
marketing, and support.  The problems required to provide those tools are
complex, deep, and not much fun to solve if you are concerned with games.</p>

<p>Using an existing solution is a good idea, if the solution is suitable.
It's difficult to find suitable solutions, though, and many of them are missing
some useful, if not critical, qualifications.</p>

<p>Twisted can be a useful solution for many games.  It provides many different
network access mechanisms, including a flexible, general client-server protocol
and web publishing.  Spanning these protocols are useful abstractions like
authentication.</p>

<p>Twisted was designed with security in mind.  It is important to the
development team to keep it secure and stable, since it is used to run the
twistedmatrix.com domain.</p>

<p>Twisted is extensible at many levels.  If the functionality you need doesn't
exist, the hook to build it probably does.  A large and diverse development
community ensures that this will continue to be the case. </p>

<p>Very few people will need all of what Twisted has to offer, but it's still
not hard to apply only some of it, by providing only one or two ancillary game
services from a Twisted server.  Evaluating an infrastructure decision is very
important.</p>
