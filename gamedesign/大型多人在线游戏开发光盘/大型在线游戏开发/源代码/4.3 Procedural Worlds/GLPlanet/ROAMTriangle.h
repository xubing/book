/****************************************************************************
* Class: CROAMTriangle
*****************************************************************************
* This class implements the ROAM triangle. It is quite large because it
* relies heavily on caching information so it doesn't have to calculate things
* every frame. Some deal with calculating split priority while others deal
* with handling the actual split. Like CVertex, it is derived from CListNode
* and uses CMemoryBlock if USE_ALLOCATOR is defined.
*
* Note that the parent pointer points to the parent of this triangle, but this
* is still not a tree-like structure! I do not keep a binary tree of all
* triangles used to reach the current model, I only keep the triangles that
* are part of the current model. When I split 2 triangles into 4, I modify
* the 2 existing triangles and add 2 new ones, setting the parent pointers of
* the new triangles to point to the existing ones. Later when I merge 4 into
* 2, the two child triangles get deleted and the parents get changed back.
*
* One more important thing to note is vertex and edge order. ROAM will only
* split two right triangles that make up a square, so I think of every
* triangle as a right triangle (even though it's not really a right triangle
* because it's on a sphere). My vertices always run counter-clockwise with
* the middle vertex being in the middle. Edges are handled in a similar
* fashion. Edge 0 indicates vertices 0 - 1, edge 1 indicates vertices 1 - 2,
* and edge 2 indicates vertices 2 - 0.
*
* It looks something like this:
* (square)
* 1----0 /2   Note: m_pEdge[2] is always the edge that is split, and a
* |   /	/ |         triangle can be split only if m_pEdge[2]->m_pEdge[2]
* |  / /  |         points back to itself. If it doesn't, its neighbor must
* | / /   |         be split first (recursively).
* 2/ 0----1
