/****************************************************************************
* Class: CROAMDiamond
*****************************************************************************
* This class implements the ROAM diamond. A diamond represents a set of 4
* triangles that can be merged. ROAM's constraints say that you can't merge
* triangles that have themselves been split until they are merged. So unless
* you plan to build the entire tree every frame, you need to keep a list of
* diamonds that can currently be merged. Every split causes existing diamonds
* to be destroyed and new ones to be created and so does every merge, so
* keeping track of them properly is important. Most of the code for that is
* in CROAMSphere.
