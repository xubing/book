# objmgr.py
#
# Implements the ability to address objects by an 
# id, avoiding the need to hold on to object references.
# This prevents reference counting and garbage collection
# problems associated with circular references.
# 
# The deferred call implementation uses object ids to
# identify the recipient of a deferred method call.
