# deferred.py
#
# Implement a deferred (asynchronous) call framework.
# Allows the storing of method and function calls in
# a list, sorted by the time in which they are to be 
# called. Using this module, a client may schedule a
# call on any object that is addressable via the objmgr
# module (i.e. has an id).
